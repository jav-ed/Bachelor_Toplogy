\chapter*{Abstract}

The aim of this thesis is to extend a Matlab code, which has been extensively investigated for academic 2D load cases, to the third dimension. For this purpose, Matlab will be continued. The proven 2D code is an adaptation topology optimization method, with which it is possible to mechanically reinforce an existing structure in retrospect by adding new structures.
In this regard, a method is presented with which corner and edge connections
can be prevented.
In order to have a reasonable post processor for both 2D and 3D results,
 Paraview is introduced.
Furthermore, FEA (Finite Element Analysis)
with Hyperworks Optistruct, are 
performed to see if the overall stiffness is increased through the
Adapt.\\

Afterwards features are presented with 
which the Adapt-load can be slightly different or a new load
compared to the Basis-load.
These features include, controlling the tangential thickness
of a connection, defining a minimum distance between
multiple connections and preventing local reinforcements.
Finally a method is presented in order to 
load a .stl file into Matlab. This serves to 
load a external Basis in both 2D and 3D for the Adapt.
The appendix offers brief explanations of some 
useful paraview-functions for 3D topology optimisation.
